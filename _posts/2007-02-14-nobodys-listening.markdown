Peep the style and the kids checking for it 
The number one question is 
How could you ignore it 
We drop right back in the cut 
Over basement tracks 
With raps that got you backing this up like 
(rewind that) 
We&rsquo;re just rolling with the rhythm 
Rise from the ashes of the stylistic division 
With these non-stop lyrics of life living 
Not to be forgotten 
But still unforgiven 
But in the meantime there are those who wanna 
Talk this and that 
So I suppose it gets to a point 
Feelings gotta get hurt 
And get dirty with the people spreading the dirt 
(It goes) 
Try to give you warning 
But everyone ignores me 
(Told you everything loud and clear) 
But nobody&rsquo;s listening 
Call to you so clearly 
But you don&rsquo;t want to hear me 
(Told you everything loudu and clear) 
But nobody&rsquo;s listening 
I got a 
Heart full of pain 
Head full of stress 
Handfull of anger 
Held in my chest 
And everything left is aw aste of time 
I hate my rhymes 
(But I hate everyone else&rsquo;s more) 
I&rsquo;m riding on the back of this pressure 
Guessing that it&rsquo;s better 
I cant keep myself together 
Because all of this stress 
Gave me something to write on 
The pain gave me something 
I could set my sights on 
You never forget the blood sweat and tears 
The uphill struggle over years 
The fear and the trash talking 
And the people it was to 
And the people that started it 
Just like you 
I got a 
Heart full of pain 
Head full of stress 
Handful of anger 
Held in my chest 
Uphill struggle 
Blood, sweat and tears 
Nothing to gain 
Everything to fear 
(Coming at you)
