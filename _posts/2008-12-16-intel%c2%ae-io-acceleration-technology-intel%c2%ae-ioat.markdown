<p class="intro">Intel&reg; I/O Acceleration Technology (Intel&reg; I/OAT),
with Intel&reg; QuickData Technology, moves data more efficiently through
Intel&reg; Xeon&reg; processor-based servers for fast, scalable, and reliable
network performance.

<h2>Performance</h2>
A
primary benefit of Intel I/OAT is its ability to significantly reduce
CPU overhead, freeing resources for more critical tasks. Intel I/OAT
uses the server's processors more efficiently by leveraging
architectural improvements within the CPU, chipset, network controller,
and firmware to minimize performance-limiting bottlenecks. Intel I/OAT
accelerates TCP/IP processing, delivers data-movement efficiencies
across the entire server platform, and minimizes system overhead.
<h2>Scalability</h2>
Intel
I/OAT provides network acceleration that scales seamlessly across
multiple Gigabit Ethernet (GbE) ports. It cost-effectively scales up to
eight GbE ports and up to 10GbE, with power and thermal characteristics
similar to those of a standard gigabit network adapter. TCP Offload
Engine (TOE) solutions, in contrast, require a separate TOE card for
each port, resulting in significant cost and thermal challenges for
server platforms.
<h2>Reliability</h2>
Intel I/OAT
is a safe and flexible choice because it is tightly integrated into
popular operating systems such as Microsoft Windows Server* 2003 and
Linux*, avoiding support risks associated with relying on third-party
hardware vendors for network stack updates. Intel I/OAT also preserves
critical network configurations such as teaming and failover, by
maintaining control of the network stack processing within the
CPU-where it belongs. This results in reduced support risks for IT
departments.
